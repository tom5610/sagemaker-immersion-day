    "> When working though notebooks, take the time to understand what every cell is doing. Read API docs, add your own code modifications, and go through related tutorials for new modules you have not worked with before. It is easy to just \"run\" though the notebook, but you will not learn anything by just clicking \"run\"!\n",
